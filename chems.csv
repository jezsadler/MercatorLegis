Wargear Name,Description,Additional Rules
Frenzon,"A fighter under the influence of Frenzon gains the Nerves of Steel, True Grit, Unstoppable and Berserk skills, however, all their weapons count as having the Reckless trait. Unless the fighter is Standing and Engaged or Prone and Seriously Injured, the fighter must use at least one of their actions to move toward the nearest enemy fighter or perform a Charge (Double) action against a visible enemy if one is within range. Side Effects: During the Wrap-up, any fighter who used Frenzon must make a Toughness check, adding 2 to the dice roll. If the check is failed, the fighter has become addicted to Frenzon. Once a fighter is addicted to Frenzon, they can only be included in a crew if they have taken a dose of the chem. The only way a fighter can shake this addiction is to pay 2D6x10 credits for anti-addiction chems during the post-battle sequence when the gang is buying equipment.","{'Skills' : {'Nerves of Steel','True Grit','Unstoppable','Berserk'},'Weapon Traits' : {'Reckless'}}"
Ghast,"When a fighter uses Ghast, they roll a D6. On a 1, they become subject to the Insane condition. On a 2-5, they gain a random psychic power from the Wyrd Powers table. On a 6, they both gain a random psychic power and become subject to the Insane condition. Side Effects: At the end of any battle in which a fighter used Ghast, they must make a Willpower test. If the test is failed, the fighter suffers a decrease of 1 to their Willpower. If a natural 12 is rolled for the test, the fighter’s mind is permanently damaged and they must begin any future battles subject to the Insane condition.",
Icrotic Slime,"When a fighter uses Icrotic Slime, make a Characteristic check for their Movement, Strength, Toughness, Initiative, Attacks and Cool characteristics. For each check that is passed, improve that characteristic by D3. Side Effects: Whilst under the effects of Icrotic Slime, the fighter’s Leadership, Intelligence and Willpower are decreased to 10+ (unless these characteristics are already worse than this). At the end of any battle in which a fighter used Icrotic Slime, roll 2D6 for that fighter. On a roll of 2, the slime eats the fighter’s brain and they are killed. Immediately remove them from the gang’s roster. On a roll of 3-11, the slime is successfully removed but the fighter is placed Into Recovery. On a roll of 12, the slime is successfully removed but not without complications. Make a roll on the Lasting Injury table against the fighter, re-rolling results of Bitter Enmity, Captured, Critical Injury and Memorable Death.",
Kalma,"A gang can give Kalma to a fighter they hold captive during the Rescue scenario. When a fighter affected by Kalma wishes to make an action, roll 2D6 for them and add their Toughness. On a roll of 11 or lower, they do nothing and the action is wasted. On a roll of 12 or more, they shake off the effects of the chem and can act normally for the remainder of the battle. Side Effects: None.",
Obscura,"In addition to other methods of use, a gang can give Obscura to a fighter they hold captive during the Rescue scenario. A fighter under the influence of Obscura changes their Movement characteristic to D6"" and all their weapons count as having the Reckless trait. Note that when they move, a fighter under the influence of Obscura must move the full distance rolled in a straight line, even if this would take them into base contact with an enemy fighter, in which case they will engage that enemy fighter, or over the edge of a ledge. Fighters under the influence of Obscura must still respect the 1"" rule – if they cannot get into base contact with an enemy fighter when moving, they must stop 1"" away. In the End phase of each round a fighter affected by Obscura may, if their controlling player wishes, roll 2D6 and add their Toughness. If the result is 12 or more, they shake off the effects of the chem. Side Effects: When a dose of Obscura wears off, the fighter enters a deep melancholy and they may only perform a single action in each of their activations for the remainder of the battle. During the Wrap-up, any fighter who used Obscura must make a Toughness check. If the check is failed, the fighter has become addicted to Obscura. Once a fighter is addicted to Obscura, they can only be included in a crew on a D6 roll of a 4+ prior to the battle. The only way a fighter can shake this addiction is to pay 2D6x10 credits for anti-addiction chems during the post-battle sequence when the gang is buying equipment.","{'Weapon Traits' : {'Reckless'}}"
’Slaught,"A fighter affected by ’Slaught increases their Weapon Skill and Initiative to 2+ and adds 1 to their Attacks characteristic. Side Effects: During the Wrap-up, any fighter who used ’Slaught must make a Toughness check. If the check is failed, the fighter has become addicted to ’Slaught. In each future battle the fighter takes part in, if they do not take a dose of ’Slaught, they must decrease their Weapon Skill and Initiative to 5+, and their Attacks to 1 (unless these characteristics are already worse than this). If they take a dose, the effects are reduced and their Weapon Skill and Initiative become 3+ and they gain no bonus to their Attacks characteristics. A fighter can shake their addiction to ’Slaught by voluntarily going into Recovery during any post-battle sequence.",
Spur,"A fighter affected by Spur increases their Movement characteristic by 2"" and improves their Initiative characteristic to 2+. Side Effects: Once a fighter has taken a dose of Spur, they must check to see if it wears off in each subsequent End phase. Roll 2D6 for the fighter and add their Toughness. If the result is 10 or more, the Spur has worn off and the fighter is no longer subject to its effects.",
Stinger Mould,"A dose of Stinger Mould can be used after a fighter has rolled on the Lasting Injury table. If the result of the roll was anything other than a 66 – Memorable Death, the result is ignored (including positive results such as 11 – Lesson Learned) and the fighter is instead Out Cold. Alternatively, a fighter can attempt to use a dose of Stinger Mould to remove an existing Lasting Injury. During Step 6 of the post-battle sequence, after distributing equipment but before updating the gang roster, roll a D6 for any fighter attempting to use Stinger Mould in this way. On a 5 or 6, the effects of one Lasting Injury the fighter has suffered are immediately negated.Side Effects: None.",
Stimm - Bad Blood,"When a fighter under the effects of this chem suffers one or more Wounds and/ or Flesh Wounds, all fighters in base contact with them must make an Initiative check. If this check is failed, they are considered to have taken a hit from a weapon with the Toxin trait.","{'Weapon Traits' : {'Toxin'}}"
Stimm - Blood Rush,"When this stimm is administered to a fighter, that fighter may remove a single Flesh Wound or immediately recover from being Seriously Injured.",
Stimm - Brain Lock,"A fighter under the effects of this stimm counts as a Psyker for the purposes of disrupting enemy psychic powers (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook).",
Stimm - Dreamland,"A fighter under the effects of this stimm ignores the effects of the Insane condition.",
Stimm - Hyper,"A fighter under the effects of this stimm increases their Movement characteristic by 2"", and, when they take the Charge (Double) Action, they add D6"" to their movement rather than D3"". This increased level of hyper-activity makes them exceptionally twitchy, and they must reduce all their hit rolls by 1.",
Stimm - Ice Cold,"A fighter under the effects of this stimm adds 2 to any Cool checks they are required to make.",
Stimm - Jolt,"Until the end of the round in which this stimm was administered, a fighter under the effects of this stimm counts any Serious Injuries they suffer as Flesh Wounds.",
Stimm - Night Night,"When a fighter under the effects of this stimm goes Out of Action, do not roll for a Lasting Injury. Instead, the fighter counts as having rolled a result of 12-26 Out Cold on the Lasting Injury table. Note that the fighter may still be captured as normal.",
Stimm - Puke,"A fighter under the effects of this stimm doubles their Toughness when testing to see if they are affected by weapons with the Toxin or Gas traits.",
Stimm - Wide-Eye,"A fighter under the effects of this stimm ignores the effects of the Pitch Black rules. In addition, if the fighter is a Sentry in a battle using the Sneak Attack rules (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook) then they always count enemy fighters as being ‘in the open’.",
