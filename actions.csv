Hide in the Wastes,Double,"If this fighter is at least 12"" away from the nearest enemy model, they gain the Hidden condition (see the Necromunda: Core Rulebook) even if the current battle is not using the Pitch Black rules. They become Revealed if they move as well as all the normal triggers for becoming Revealed."
Enrage,Simple,"All friendly fighters gain +D3” movement until the End phase of this round if all the following conditions are true: Readied. Active. Completely within 6”"
Headbutt,Free,"Pick an enemy fighter engaged by, and in base contact with, this fighter and roll two D6. If either result is equal to or higher than their Toughness, they suffer a hit with a Strength equal to this fighter’s +2, resolved at Damage 2. However, if both dice score lower than the enemy fighter’s Toughness, this fighter instead suffers a hit equal to their own Strength, resolved at Damage 1."
Hurl,Basic,"Pick an enemy fighter engaged by and in base contact with this fighter, or a Prone and Seriously Injured enemy fighter within 1"" of this fighter. Make an Initiative test for the enemy fighter. If failed, the enemy fighter is hurled. Move the enemy fighter D3"" in a direction of your choice – if they were Standing, they become Prone and Pinned after moving. If they come into base contact with a Standing fighter, vehicle or any terrain, they stop moving and suffer a Strength 3, Damage 1 hit. If they come into base contact with another model, that model also suffers a Strength 3, Damage 1 hit, and if the model is a fighter, they become Prone and Pinned. This action can also be performed for free after successfully performing a Charge (Double) action instead of a free Fight (Basic) action."
