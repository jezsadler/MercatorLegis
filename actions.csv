Action Name,Action Type,Description,Additional Rules
Hide in the Wastes,Double,"If this fighter is at least 12"" away from the nearest enemy model, they gain the Hidden condition (see the Necromunda: Core Rulebook) even if the current battle is not using the Pitch Black rules. They become Revealed if they move as well as all the normal triggers for becoming Revealed."
Enrage,Simple,"All friendly fighters gain +D3” movement until the End phase of this round if all the following conditions are true: Readied. Active. Completely within 6”"
Headbutt,Free,"Pick an enemy fighter engaged by, and in base contact with, this fighter and roll two D6. If either result is equal to or higher than their Toughness, they suffer a hit with a Strength equal to this fighter’s +2, resolved at Damage 2. However, if both dice score lower than the enemy fighter’s Toughness, this fighter instead suffers a hit equal to their own Strength, resolved at Damage 1."
Hurl,Basic,"Pick an enemy fighter engaged by and in base contact with this fighter, or a Prone and Seriously Injured enemy fighter within 1"" of this fighter. Make an Initiative test for the enemy fighter. If failed, the enemy fighter is hurled. Move the enemy fighter D3"" in a direction of your choice – if they were Standing, they become Prone and Pinned after moving. If they come into base contact with a Standing fighter, vehicle or any terrain, they stop moving and suffer a Strength 3, Damage 1 hit. If they come into base contact with another model, that model also suffers a Strength 3, Damage 1 hit, and if the model is a fighter, they become Prone and Pinned."
Order,Double,"Make a Leadership test for this model. If the test is passed, pick a friendly fighter within 6"". That fighter can immediately make two actions as though it were their turn to activate, even if they are not Ready. If they are Ready, these actions do not remove their Ready marker."
Hide in the Wastes,Double,"Become Hidden (even in battles without Pitch Black). Become Revealed if moving (in addition to normal triggers)."
Lay Mine,Basic,"The vehicle moves forwards in a straight line up to its Movement characteristic, no turns may be made. At any point during this move a melta trap may be placed on the battlefield within the vehicle’s Rear arc and within 1"" of the vehicle. It cannot be triggered until after this is completed."
Embark,Basic,"If this fighter is within 1"" of a transport cage’s access point, remove them from the battlefield. They are now embarked in the transport cage."
Disembark,Basic,"If this fighter is embarked in a transport cage, place them within 1"" of the transport cage’s access point and at least 1"" away from any enemy fighters. This may mean that fighters cannot disembark from a transport cage."
Launch Smoke,Basic,"Place three markers within 2"" of this vehicle. These markers act like smoke grenades."
Treat Wounds,Basic,"Roll a D6. On a 3+ a friendly fighter within 1"" either regains a lost Wound or loses a Flesh Wound (controlling player’s choice)."
Run and Gun,Double,"The fighter may move up to double their Movement characteristic and then make an attack with a ranged weapon. The hit roll suffers an additional -1 modifier, and Unwieldy weapons can never be used in conjunction with this skill."
Engage Magnacles,Basic,"The target enemy in base contact must make an Initiative test to avoid the Magnacles. If this test is failed they are locked in place and cannot move, cannot make ranged attacks and can only make melee attacks at -2 to hit. The target can attempt to free themselves by performing a Break Bonds (Double) action."
Break Bonds,Double,"Roll 2D6. If the result is equal or lower than the fighter's Strength then they have freed themselves, otherwise they remain trapped. Each friendly fighter in base contact with the target adds 2 to their Strength for the purposes of this roll."
Descend,Basic,"The fighter makes a move of up to 3"" horizontally and up to 12"" vertically. Any vertical movement must be downwards, i.e., towards the ground."
Grapnel,Double,"The fighter can move up to 12"" in a straight line, in any direction. This move can take them to a different level, as long as they do not move through any terrain."
Tap Psi-grub,Basic,"Roll a D6. If the result is equal to or lower than the number of Psi-grub tokens on this fighter's card, the Psi-grub is triggered, otherwise there is no effect. When the Psi-grub is triggered, remove all Psi-grub tokens from the fighter’s card and immediately use one of the fighter’s psychic powers just as if they had taken a Wyrd Power (X) action. This action does not require the fighter to make a Willpower test."
Swig Second Best,Simple,"Every time a fighter makes this action, place an Intoxicated marker on their card and remove one of their Flesh Wounds (if they have any). Intoxicated markers remain until the end of the battle. The effects of the booze are dependent on how many markers they have on their card. 1 marker: -1 to ranged attack hit rolls, +1 to the result of Cool tests; 2 markers: -2 to ranged attack hit rolls, +2 to the result of Cool tests. If the fighter makes two Move actions in a row, they must pass an Initiative test after completing the second action or become Prone and Pinned; 3+ markers: -3 to ranged attack hit rolls and -1 to melee attack hit rolls, +3 to the result of Cool tests. When the fighter makes a Move action, instead of using the fighter’s Movement characteristic, move the fighter D6"" in a direction determined by the Scatter dice."
Swig Wild Snake,Simple,"Every time a fighter makes this action, place an Intoxicated marker on their card and remove one of their Flesh Wounds (if they have any). Intoxicated markers remain until the end of the battle. The effects of the booze are dependent on how many markers they have on their card. 1 marker: -1 to ranged attack hit rolls, +2 to the result of Cool tests; 2 markers: -1 to ranged attack hit rolls, +3 to the result of Cool tests. When making ranged attack hit rolls after choosing a target, randomise the actual target of the attack between the intended target and any model (friend or foe) within 6"" of them; 3+ markers: -2 to ranged attack hit rolls, automatically pass any Cool tests."
Can of Worms,Basic,"When Threadneedle worms are used, roll a D6. 1: Roll an Injury dice for the fighter using the Threadneedle Worms; 2-3: Place a 5"" Blast marker anywhere within D6"" of the fighter then roll an Injury dice for each fighter under the marker; 4-5: Place a 5"" Blast marker anywhere within D6"" of the fighter, then place two additional 5"" Blast markers so they are in contact with the first marker. Roll an Injury dice for each fighter under any of the markers; 6: Roll an Injury dice for every enemy fighter on the battlefield, treating Out of Action results as Seriously Injured."
