Wargear Name,Description
ABLATIVE OVERLAY,"The first time a fighter wearing an ablative overlay is required to make a save, their save is 2 better than normal (i.e., a model with a 5+ save would gain a 3+ save). A model without a save gains a 5+ save. The second time they must make a save, it becomes 1 better than normal or 6+ if they did not already have a save. After the fighter has been hit twice, the ablative overlay is spent and has no further effect on the battle, but is retained by the fighter and may be used again in future battles."
ARCHAEO-CARAPACE,"An Archaeo-carapace grants its wearer a 4+ save. If the wearer suffers a Lasting Injury result of Humiliated, Head Injury, Eye Injury, Hand Injury, Hobbled, Spinal Injury or Enfeebled, instead of suffering the effects of the injury they gain a bionic (see Bionics) appropriate to the location damaged (i.e., if a Head Injury was suffered, they would gain a Cortex-cogitator bionic). These bionics do not increase the fighter’s characteristics. Unlike normal bionics, they cannot be damaged or destroyed, and if the fighter suffers an injury to a location already replaced by a bionic then the injury is ignored. Transformation into a blasphemous cyber-creature is not without its perils, however. Whenever the fighter activates they must roll a D6. If the result is less than the number of bionics they currently have, they gain the Insane condition. If the fighter ever has six or more bionics, they vanish into the underhive never to be seen again – the player must remove the fighter from their gang roster                                                                                                                                                                             "
ARMORWEAVE,"Armourweave grants its wearer a save of 5+. This save cannot be reduced to lower than 6+ by AP or other modifiers, though attacks that do not allow a save will ignore Armourweave as normal."
CARAPACE ARMOR - LIGHT,Light carapace armour grants a 4+ save roll.
CARAPACE ARMOR - HEAVY,"Heavy carapace armour grants a 4+ save roll. This is increased to 3+ against attacks originating within the fighter’s vision arc (the 90° arc to their front); check this before the fighter model is placed Prone and is Pinned. If it is not clear if the attacker is within the fighter’s front arc, use a Vision Arc template to check – if the centre of the attacker’s base is within the arc, use the 3+ save roll. Against attacks with the Blast trait, use the centre of the Blast marker in place of the attacker. If the fighter does not have a facing (for example, if they are prone), use the 4+ save roll. However, due to the extra weight of this armour, the fighter’s Initiative is reduced by -1 and their movement by 1"" when making a Charge action."
CERAMITE SHIELD,"A fighter with a Ceramite shield adds +2 to their save against attacks originating in their line of sight provided they are Standing, however for the wielder the Move action becomes a (Basic) action rather than a (Simple) action. A fighter with a Ceramite shield ignores the effects of the Melta trait if an attack originates in their line of sight. A fighter can be equipped with a Ceramite shield in addition to a suit of armour, however a fighter carrying a Ceramite shield reduces the number of weapons they can carry by one."
FLAK ARMOR,"Flak armour grants a 6+ save roll. Against weapons that use a Blast marker or Flame template, this is increased to a 5+ save roll."
GUTTERFORGED CLOAK,"A Gutterforged cloak grants its wearer a save of 6+, or a save of 5+ against damage resulting from Underhive Perils or environmental effects."
HAZARD SUIT,"A hazard suit grants a 6+ save roll. Additionally, when a hazard suit is combined with a respirator, the fighter’s Toughness is increased by 3 against Gas attacks, rather than the usual 2. Finally, a fighter wearing a hazard suit is immune to the Blaze and Rad-phage traits."
MANTLE MALIFICA,"A Mantle Malifica grants its wearer a 5+ save, or an unmodifiable 4+ save against the effects of psychic powers. Note that this save, if successful, does not cancel the use of a psychic power, it only renders the wearer immune to the power’s effects. In the End phase of each round, the wearer must make a Willpower test or gain the Insane condition."
MESH ARMOR,Mesh armour grants a 5+ save roll.
REFLEC SHROUD,"A reflec shroud grants its wearer a save of 5+. The wearer also counts the AP of las, plasma and melta weapons as ‘-’ regardless of their actual AP."
SCRAP SHIELD,"A fighter can be equipped with a scrap shield in addition to a suit of armour. The scrap shield offers no protection against ranged attacks, but while Standing and Engaged, the fighter increases their save by 1 against Reaction attacks."
ARMORED BODYGLOVE,+1 Save. Ignores the effects of Rad-phage. Can be combined with other armour.
ARMORED UNDERSUIT,"If a fighter is wearing an armoured undersuit, their save roll is improved by 1. For example, if they are wearing flak armour and an armoured undersuit, they would have a 5+ save, which would be increased to 4+ against Blasts. If a fighter does not already have a save roll, an armoured undersuit grants a 6+ save."
FURNACE PLATES,6+ save (5+ in the front vision arc).
Hardened Flak Armor,6+ save (5+ against Blast/Template). Reduce the AP by 1 (to a minimum of -1).
Layered Flak Armor,5+ save (4+ against Blast/Template).
Hardened Layered Flak Armor,5+ save (4+ against Blast/Template). Reduce the AP by 1 (to a minimum of -1).
PLATE MAIL,"Plate mail grants a 6+ save roll. This is increased to a 5+ save roll against attacks originating within the fighter’s vision arc (the 90° arc to their front); check this before the fighter model is placed Prone and is Pinned. If it is not clear if the attacker is within the fighter’s front arc, use a Vision Arc template to check – if the centre of the attacker’s base is within the arc, use the 5+ save roll. Against attacks with the Blast trait, plate mail always grants a 5+ save roll."
CONVERSION FIELD,"When a fighter wearing a conversion field is hit by an attack, roll a D6. On a 5+, the conversion field works and the attack has no further effect. However, any fighters, friend or foe, within 3"" of the wearer count as being hit by a weapon with the Flash trait as the field flares up in a tremendous burst of light. Note that the wearer is unaffected by this flash of light as they are inside the field."
DISPLACER FIELD,"For each hit a fighter wearing a displacer field suffers, roll a D6. On a 4+, the fighter is protected from harm by the field and the hit is ignored (even if any part of the fighter is still under the template – if the attack used one – after being displaced as described below). If a fighter is saved from one or more hits by a displacer field, they will be moved once as the field displaces them. The fighter is moved a number of inches equal to the Strength of the attack in a random direction, determined by rolling a Scatter dice. A displacer field will not deposit its wearer inside a terrain feature – the fighter will move by the shortest route possible so that it can be placed clear of any impassable terrain features. Similarly, the fighter’s base cannot overlap another fighter’s base and the wearer must be moved by the shortest route possible until its base can be placed without overlapping. Note that the wearer may not end up within 1"" of an enemy fighter as a result of being displaced and must be moved by the shortest possible route so that they can be placed 1"" away. If a fighter wearing a displacer field is transported off the battlefield, they immediately go Out of Action. Do not roll on the Lasting Injury chart, they are automatically Out Cold. If an attack does not have a Strength value, then a displacer field cannot work against it."
REFRACTOR FIELD,"When a fighter wearing a refractor field is hit by an attack, roll a D6. On a 5+, the hit is ignored. However, should the field work and the hit be ignored, roll another D6. If the result is a 1, then the field has been overburdened by the attack and its generator is burned out. Remove the refractor field from the fighter’s card – it no longer works."
