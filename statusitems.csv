Wargear Name,Description,Additional Rules
Gold-Plated Gun,"A fighter with a gold-plated gun improves their Leadership characteristic by 1. Additionally, once per battle, the fighter may re-roll a failed Ammo test.",
Uphive Raiments,"If this fighter is not In Recovery during the post-battle sequence, their gang gains an extra D3x10 credits during the Collect Income step.",
Sensor skull,"A sensor skull grants the owning fighter the same benefits as a bio-scanner. In addition, when the fighter takes an Aim (Basic) action, they may add 2 to the result of any hit rolls they make for subsequent shots taken in the same activation rather than the usual 1. This bonus is in addition to any granted by any other Wargear or skills the fighter may have.","{'Wargear':{'Bio-scanner'}}"
Medi skull,"When making a Recovery test for the owning fighter, roll an extra Injury dice, then choose one of the dice to resolve and discard the other. This is in addition to any friendly fighters assisting the recovery and any other items such as medicae kits, so it is possible that the owning fighter may be rolling several Injury dice to choose from.",
Gun skull,"A gun skull is equipped with a compact autopistol and will target whatever or whoever the owning fighter does when they make a ranged attack. Simply roll one extra hit dice and one extra Ammo dice for the gun skull, ideally of a different colour to those being used for the fighter, to represent the gun skull making a ranged attack. Note though that range, line of sight and cover must be worked out from the gun skull itself rather than that of the owning fighter. If the owning fighter does not possess any ranged weapons, the gun skull may shoot at an enemy it can see, chosen by the owning fighter and following the normal target priority rules in relation to the owning fighter’s position. The owning fighter is never considered to be in the way of a gun skull’s shooting attacks and cannot be hit by stray shots. A gun skull has a BS of 5+, and may never benefit fromaiming or any Wargear or skills that modify the owning fighter’s hit rolls.",
