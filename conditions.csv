Condition Name,Description,Additional Rules
Blaze,"Models with the Blaze condition can never become Hidden and cannot make Reaction attacks. There are additional effects depending on whether the model is a fighter or a vehicle.","{'Conditions':{'Blaze (Fighter)','Blaze (Vehicle)'}}"
Blaze (Fighter),"When activated, a fighter subject to the Blaze condition suffers an immediate S3, AP -1, D1 hit (see Resolving Hits) and must act as follows, after which their activation will end: If Prone and Pinned, the fighter immediately becomes Standing and Active and acts as described below. If Standing and Active, the fighter moves 2D6"" in a random direction, determined by the Scatter dice. The fighter will stop moving if this movement would bring them within 1"" of an enemy fighter or into base contact with impassable terrain. If this movement brings them within ½"" of the edge of a level or platform, they risk falling. If this movement takes the fighter beyond the edge of a level or platform, they will simply fall. At the end of this move, the fighter may choose to become Prone and Pinned. The fighter may then attempt to put the fire out. If Standing and Engaged or Prone and Seriously Injured, the fighter does not move and attempts to put the fire out. To attempt to put the fire out, roll a D6, adding 1 to the result for each other Active friendly fighter within 1"". On a roll of 6 or more, the flames go out and the Blaze condition is removed. Prone and Pinned or Seriously Injured fighters add 2 to the roll to see if the flames go out.",
Blaze (Vehicle),"When activated, a vehicle subject to the Blaze condition suffers an immediate S3, AP -1, D1 hit against the Rear Toughness (roll location as normal). They must then make a Cool test. If passed, nothing happens, they can continue their activation as normal. If failed and the vehicle is Mobile, they act as if they had failed a Loss of Control test then their activation ends. If failed and the vehicle is Stationary and Stalled, they must perform the Burn Out (Double) action then their activation ends. At the end of their activation, roll a D6. On a 4+, the flames go out and the Blaze condition is removed.",
Blind,"A Blind model loses their Ready marker; if they do not have a Ready marker, they do not gain a Ready marker at the start of the following round. Until the next time the model is activated, they cannot make any attacks other than Reaction attacks, for which any hit rolls will only succeed on a natural 6 (note: vehicles cannot make Reaction attacks).",
Broken,"A broken model has restricted actions, depending on whether it is a fighter or a vehicle. Broken models can be rallied in the End Phase.","{'Conditions':{'Broken (Fighter)','Broken (Vehicle)'}}"
Broken (Fighter),"Broken fighters may not perform any actions other than Running for Cover (Double), which they perform every time they are activated. If Standing and Engaged, a Broken fighter may only make Reaction attacks, and must apply a -2 modifier to their Hit rolls.",
Broken (Vehicle),"Broken vehicles may not perform any actions other than Break For Air (Double) if Mobile or Burn Out (Double) if Stationary and Stalled, which they perform every time they are activated.",
Concussed (Fighter),"Initiative reduced by 2, to a minimum of 6+, until the end of the round.",
Concussed (Vehicle),"Suffer a -2 penalty to all Handling tests until the end of the round.",
Hidden,"Hidden models may not be targets of ranged attacks or charges, except by models inside the attacker's Visibility range. Models lose Hidden and become Revealed if they make a ranged attack without the Silent trait, a melee attack with the Power trait, or move if they are a vehicle."
Insane,"When activating an Insane model, roll a D6. 1-2: The model immediately becomes Broken – or, if they were already Broken, they flee the battlefield. The opposing player can control the Insane model for the duration of this activation, treating them as part of their gang in all respects until their activation ends. As soon as their activation ends, the Insane model no longer counts as being a part of the opposing gang. 5-6: The model can act as normal for the duration of this activation. Once their activation is over, make a Willpower test for them. If it is passed, they lose their Insanity marker.","{'Conditions':{'Broken'}}"
Intoxicated (Second Best),"The effects of Second Best are dependent on how many Intoxicated markers the fighter has on their card. 1 marker: -1 to ranged attack hit rolls, +1 to the result of Cool tests; 2 markers: -2 to ranged attack hit rolls, +2 to the result of Cool tests. If the fighter makes two Move actions in a row, they must pass an Initiative test after completing the second action or become Prone and Pinned; 3+ markers: -3 to ranged attack hit rolls and -1 to melee attack hit rolls, +3 to the result of Cool tests. When the fighter makes a Move action, instead of using the fighter’s Movement characteristic, move the fighter D6"" in a direction determined by the Scatter dice.",
Intoxicated (Wild Snake),"The effects of Wild Snake are dependent on how many Intoxicated markers the fighter has on their card. 1 marker: -1 to ranged attack hit rolls, +2 to the result of Cool tests; 2 markers: -1 to ranged attack hit rolls, +3 to the result of Cool tests. When making ranged attack hit rolls after choosing a target, randomise the actual target of the attack between the intended target and any model (friend or foe) within 6"" of them; 3+ markers: -2 to ranged attack hit rolls, automatically pass any Cool tests.",
Mounted,"The fighter is subject to the Hands Full, Quick Retreat, Grounded, My Mount Is My Life, and 'I Get Knocked Down...' rules, and can perform Ride By attacks. See Ash Wastes Rulebook p36, Book of the Outlands p109, or Core Rulebook p????.", 
Revealed,"Revealed models may be targets of ranged attacks or charges, regardless of the Visibility range. In the End phase of each round, Revealed models become Hidden again unless they are also subject to the Blaze condition.","{'Conditions':{'Hidden'}}"
Webbed,"While a fighter is Webbed, treat them as if they were Seriously Injured and roll for Recovery for them during the End phase. If a Flesh Wound result is rolled during Recovery, apply the result to the fighter as usual and remove the Webbed condition. If a Serious Injury result is rolled, the fighter remains Webbed, but they do not gain a Flesh Wound. If an Out of Action result is rolled, the fighter succumbs to the powerful sedative and is removed from play. Instead of rolling on the Lasting Injury table, roll a D6 to determine what happens to them – on a result of 1-4 suffer the 15-26 (Out Cold) result, on a 5-6 they suffer the 55-56 (Captured) result."
