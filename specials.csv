That fighter makes a Willpower check as normal and, if a double 1 is rolled, it is that fighter that will suffer the effects of Perils of the Warp. However, the effect of the Wyrd Power is worked out from the model representing the Psychoteric Thrall, rather than from the model representing the fighter.
