Rule,Description
Gang Hierarchy (Leader),"During a battle, once this fighter's gang has failed a Bottle test, during any End phase in which this fighter passes its Cool check and does not flee the battlefield, any friendly fighters with the same origin that are within 12"" of this fighter will automatically pass their Cool check and will not flee the battlefield."

Terrifying,"Pass a Willpower test to target this fighter with a Fight (Basic) or Shoot (Basic) action, or the action ends immediately (wasted). However, the action does not count as being performed, so the same action can be attempted again, if the fighter has more available actions in the activation."

Unstable Platform,Fighters may not perform the Aim (Basic) action or fire weapons with the Unwieldy trait while they are embarked in a Transport Cage with Fire Points.
Transport Cage,"While embarked in a transport cage, a fighter is treated as if they are not on the battlefield, so cannot be the target of any attacks or use any abilities. If any fighters are embarked on a vehicle when it is Wrecked, they must be placed Prone within 1"" of the vehicle’s final position and then suffer a S4, AP -, D1 hit. Any fighter that cannot be placed in this way is taken Out of Action – immediately make a roll on the Lasting Injury table for them. All friendly fighters can perform the Embark (Basic) and Disembark (Basic) actions: Embark (Basic): If this fighter is within 1"" of a transport cage’s access point, remove them from the battlefield. They are now embarked in the transport cage. Disembark (Basic): If this fighter is embarked in a transport cage, place them within 1"" of the transport cage’s access point and at least 1"" away from any enemy fighters. This may mean that fighters cannot disembark from a transport cage."
