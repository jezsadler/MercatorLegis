Rule,Description
Gang Hierarchy (Leader),"During a battle, once this fighter's gang has failed a Bottle test, during any End phase in which this fighter passes its Cool check and does not flee the battlefield, any friendly fighters with the same origin that are within 12"" of this fighter will automatically pass their Cool check and will not flee the battlefield."
Gang Hierarchy (Champion),"During a battle, once this fighter's gang has failed a Bottle test, during any End phase in which this fighter passes its Cool check and does not flee the battlefield, any friendly fighters with the same origin that are within 6"" of this fighter will automatically pass their Cool check and will not flee the battlefield."
Group Activation (X),"When a fighter with this special rule is activated, their controlling player can choose to activate a number of additional Ready fighters with the same origin within 3"", up to the number shown in brackets. The controlling player must nominate all of the fighters who will be activated as part of the Group Activation before any of them is activated. Once they have been nominated, fighters are activated one at a time, not simultaneously. Additional fighters with this special rule may not themselves use this special rule during this activation."

Non-sanctioned Psyker,"Should a psyker with this skill be taken Out of Action, the enemy gang is rewarded a bounty of D3x10 credits at the end of the battle. Should a psyker with this skill be captured and sold to the Guilders, they are worth their full value. Note that when a psyker with this skill is captured, they can be sold immediately without the opportunity for a Rescue Mission."

Terrifying,"Pass a Willpower test to target this fighter with a Fight (Basic) or Shoot (Basic) action, or the action ends immediately (wasted). However, the action does not count as being performed, so the same action can be attempted again, if the fighter has more available actions in the activation."
Fearsome,"If an enemy wishes to make a Charge (Double) action that would result in them making one or more close combat attacks against this fighter, they must make a Willpower test before moving. If the test is failed, they cannot move and their activation ends immediately."
