Skill Set,Skill Name,Description,Action
AGILITY​,Catfall​,"When this fighter falls or jumps down from a ledge, they count the vertical distance moved as being half of what it actually is, rounded up. In addition, if they are not Prone and Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by a fall, make an Initiative test for them – if it is passed, they remain Standing rather than being Prone and Pinned.",
AGILITY​,Clamber​,"When this fighter climbs, the distance they move is not halved. In other words, they always count as climbing up or down a ladder.",
AGILITY​,Dodge​,"If this fighter suffers a wound from a ranged or close combat attack, roll a D6. On a 6, the attack is dodged and has no further effect; otherwise, continue to make a save or resolve the wound as normal. If the model dodges a weapon that uses a Blast marker or Flame template, a roll of 6 does not automatically cancel the attack – instead, it allows the fighter to move up to 2"" before seeing if they are hit. They cannot move within 1"" of an enemy fighter",
AGILITY​,Mighty Leap​,"When measuring the distance of a gap this fighter wishes to leap across, ignore the first 2"" of the distance. This means that a fighter with this skill may leap over gaps of 2"" or less without testing against their Initiative. All other rules for leaping over gaps still apply.",
AGILITY​,Spring Up​,"If this fighter is Prone and Pinned when they are activated, make an Initiative test for them. If the test is passed, the fighter may make a Stand Up (Basic) action for free. If the test is failed, the fighter may still stand up, but it costs one action, as usual.",
AGILITY​,Sprint​,"If this fighter makes two Move (Simple) actions when activated during a round, they can use the second to Sprint. This lets them move at double their Movement characteristic for the second Move (Simple) action.",
BRAWN​,Bull Charge​,"When the fighter makes close combat attacks as part of a Charge (Double) action, any weapons with the Melee trait they use gain the Knockback trait and are resolved at +1 Strength.",
BRAWN​,Bulging Biceps​,This fighter may wield an Unwieldy weapon in one hand rather than the usual two. Note that Unwieldy weapons still take up the space of two weapons with regards to how many a fighter may carry.,
BRAWN​,Crushing Blow​,"Before rolling to hit for the fighter’s close combat attacks, the controlling player can nominate one dice to make a Crushing Blow. This cannot be a dice that is rolling for a weapon with the Sidearm trait. If that dice hits, the attack’s Strength and Damage are increased by one.",
BRAWN​,Headbutt​,"If the fighter is Standing and Engaged, they can make the following action:","Headbutt (Free): Pick an enemy fighter engaged by, and in base contact with, this fighter and roll two D6. If either result is equal to or higher than their Toughness, they suffer a hit with a Strength equal to this fighter’s +2, resolved at Damage 2. However, if both dice score lower than the enemy fighter’s Toughness, this fighter instead suffers a hit equal to their own Strength, resolved at Damage 1."
BRAWN​,Hurl​,"If the fighter is Standing and Engaged, they can perform the following action:","Hurl (Basic): Pick an enemy fighter engaged by and in base contact with this fighter, or a Prone and Seriously Injured enemy fighter within 1"" of this fighter. Make an Initiative test for the enemy fighter. If failed, the enemy fighter is hurled. Move the enemy fighter D3"" in a direction of your choice – if they were Standing, they become Prone and Pinned after moving. If they come into base contact with a Standing fighter, vehicle or any terrain, they stop moving and suffer a Strength 3, Damage 1 hit. If they come into base contact with another model, that model also suffers a Strength 3, Damage 1 hit, and if the model is a fighter, they become Prone and Pinned. This action can also be performed for free after successfully performing a Charge (Double) action instead of a free Fight (Basic) action."
BRAWN​,Iron Jaw​,This fighter’s Toughness is treated as being two higher than normal when another fighter attacks them in close combat with a weapon with an AP characteristic of -.,
COMBAT​,Combat Master​,"The fighter never suffers penalties to their hit rolls for interference, and can always grant assists, regardless of how many enemy fighters they are engaged with.",
COMBAT​,Counter-Attack​,"When this fighter makes Reaction attacks in close combat, they roll one additional Attack dice for each of the attacker’s Attacks that failed to hit (whether they missed, were parried, etc).",
COMBAT​,Disarm​,"Any weapons with the Melee trait used by the fighter also gain the Disarm trait. If a weapon already has this Trait then the target will be disarmed on a natural roll of a 5 or 6, rather than the usual 6.",
COMBAT​,Parry​,"The fighter can parry attacks as though they were carrying a weapon with the Parry trait. If they already have one or more weapons with this Trait, they can parry one additional attack.",
COMBAT​,Rain Of Blows​,"This fighter treats the Fight action as Fight (Simple) rather than Fight (Basic). In other words, this fighter may make two Fight (Simple) actions when activated.",
COMBAT​,Step Aside​,"If the fighter is hit in close combat, the fighter can attempt to step aside. Make an Initiative test for them. If the test is passed, the attack misses. This skill can only be used once per enemy in each round of close combat – in other words, if an enemy makes more than one attack, the fighter can only attempt to step aside from one of them.",
CUNNING​,Backstab​,"Any weapons used by this fighter with the Melee trait also gain the Backstab trait. If they already have this Trait, add 2 to the attack’s Strength rather than the usual 1 when the Trait is used.",
CUNNING​,Escape Artist​,"When this fighter makes a Retreat (Basic) action, add 2 to the result of their Initiative test (a natural 1 still fails). Additionally, if this fighter is Captured at the end of a battle, and if they are equipped with a skinblade, they may add 1 to the result of the dice roll to see if they can escape during the Rescue Mission scenario.",
CUNNING​,Evade​,"If an enemy targets this fighter with a ranged attack, and this fighter is Standing and Active and not in partial cover or full cover, there is an additional -1 modifier to the hit roll, or a -2 modifier if the attack is at Long range.",
CUNNING​,Infiltrate​,"If this fighter should be set up at the start of a battle, they may instead be placed to one side. Then, immediately before the start of the first round, their controlling player may set them up anywhere on the battlefield that is not visible to any enemy fighters, and not within 6"" of any of them. If both players have fighters with this skill, take turns to set one up, starting with the winner of a roll-off.",
CUNNING​,Lie Low​,"While this fighter is Prone, enemy fighters cannot target them with a ranged attack unless they are within the attacking weapon’s Short range. Weapons that do not have a Short range are unaffected by this rule.",
CUNNING​,Overwatch​,"If this fighter is Standing and Active, and has a Ready marker on them, they can interrupt a visible enemy model’s action as soon as it is declared but before it is carried out. This fighter loses their Ready marker and then immediately makes a Shoot (Basic) action, targeting the enemy whose action they have interrupted. If the enemy is Prone and Pinned or Seriously Injured as a result, their activation ends immediately and their action(s) are not made.",
DRIVING​,Jink​,"Once per round, when their vehicle is hit by an attack, this crew may attempt to make a special Jink save which cannot be modified by a weapon’s Armour Piercing value. Roll a D6. On a roll of 6+, the crew’s quick reactions enable them to jerk the controls and avoid the attack. The hit is ignored.",
DRIVING​,Expert Driver​,"When this crew’s vehicle makes a Loss of Control test, add 1 to the result.",
DRIVING​,Heavy Foot​,"Once per round, when this crew’s vehicle performs either a Move (Simple) or a Ram (Double) action, the vehicle may increase its Movement characteristic by D3"". However, doing so is not without risks. If a natural 1 is rolled, the vehicle suffers a single Glancing Hit to its Engine.",
DRIVING​,Slalom​,"Once per round, when this crew’s vehicle performs a Move (Simple) action, it may make an additional turn of up to 45° at any point before, during or after its move.",
DRIVING​,T-Bone​,"If this crew’s vehicle has a Head-on Collision with another vehicle or terrain feature, this vehicle may add D3 to its Front Toughness characteristic until the collision is fully resolved.",
DRIVING​,Running Repairs​,"If, when making a Handling test to Restart this crew’s vehicle whilst it is Stationary and Stalled, a natural 6 is rolled, this driver has not only Restarted the vehicle but repaired some minor damage. The vehicle regains one lost Hull Point.",
FEROCITY​,Berserker​,"When this fighter makes close combat attacks as part of a Charge (Double) action, they roll one additional Attack dice.",
FEROCITY​,Fearsome​,"If an enemy wishes to make a Charge (Double) action that would result in them making one or more close combat attacks against this fighter, they must make a Willpower test before moving. If the test is failed, they cannot move and their activation ends immediately.",
FEROCITY​,Impetuous​,"When this fighter consolidates at the end of a close combat, they may move up to 4"", rather than the usual 2"".",
FEROCITY​,Nerves Of Steel​,"When the fighter is hit by a ranged attack, make a Cool test for them. If it is passed, they may choose not to become Prone and Pinned.",
FEROCITY​,True Grit​,"When making an Injury roll for this fighter, roll one less Injury dice (for example, a Damage 2 weapon would roll one dice). Against attacks with Damage 1, roll two dice – the player controlling the fighter with True Grit can then choose one dice to discard before the effects of the other are resolved.",
FEROCITY​,Unstoppable​,"Before making a Recovery test for this fighter in the End phase, roll a D6. If the result is 4 or more, one Flesh Wound they have suffered previously is discarded. If they do not have any Flesh Wounds, and the result is a 4 or more, roll one additional dice for the Recovery test and choose one to discard.",
LEADERSHIP​,Commanding Presence​,"When this fighter activates to make a group activation, they may include one more fighter than normal as part of the group (i.e., a Champion could activate two other fighters instead of one, and a Leader could activate three). This skill cannot be gained by a vehicle and, if randomly selected, a new skill is randomly selected.",
LEADERSHIP​,Inspirational​,"If a friendly model within 6"" of this model fails a Cool test, make a Leadership test for this model. If the Leadership test is passed then the Cool test also counts as having been passed.",
LEADERSHIP​,Iron Will​,Subtract 1 from the result of any of your Bottle checks whilst this model is on the battlefield and is not Prone and Seriously Injured or Wrecked.,
LEADERSHIP​,Mentor​,"Make a Leadership test for this model each time another friendly model within 6"" gains XP. If the test is passed, the other model gains an additional XP.",
LEADERSHIP​,Overseer​,"If the model is Standing and Active or Mobile, they can attempt to make the following action:","Order (Double): Make a Leadership test for this model. If the test is passed, pick a friendly fighter within 6"". That fighter can immediately make two actions as though it were their turn to activate, even if they are not Ready. If they are Ready, these actions do not remove their Ready marker."
LEADERSHIP​,Regroup​,"If this model is Standing and Active or Mobile at the end of their activation, the controlling player may make a Leadership test for them. If this test is passed, each friendly model that is currently subject to the Broken condition and is within 6"" immediately recovers from being Broken.",
SAVANT​,Ballistics Expert​,"When this model makes an Aim (Basic) action, make an Intelligence test for them. If the test is passed, they gain an additional +1 modifier to their hit roll.",
SAVANT​,Connected​,"This model can make a Trade action during the post-battle sequence, in addition to any other actions they make (meaning they could even make two Trade actions). They cannot do this if they are unable to make actions during the post-battle sequence.",
SAVANT​,Fixer​,"In the Receive Rewards step of the post-battle sequence, as long as this model is not Captured or In Recovery, their gang earns an additional D3x10 credits. Note that they do not need to have taken part in the battle to gain this bonus.",
SAVANT​,Medicae​,"This skill cannot be gained by a vehicle and if randomly selected, a new skill is randomly selected. This fighter may make the Treat Wounds (Basic) action:","Treat Wounds (Basic): Roll a D6. On a 3+ a friendly fighter within 1"" either regains a lost Wound or loses a Flesh Wound (controlling player’s choice)."
SAVANT​,Munitioneer​,"Whenever an Ammo test is failed for this model, or another model from their gang within 6"", it can be re-rolled.",
SAVANT​,Savvy Trader​,"When this model makes a Trade action in the post-battle sequence, add an additional 1 to the result of the dice roll to determine the Availability level of Rare/Illegal items on offer at the Trading Post on this visit. Additionally, the cost of one item may be reduced by 20 credits on this visit. Note that this means one item, not one type of item. A single power sword may be purchased for 30 credits, but a second power sword will still cost 50 credits.",
SHOOTING​,Fast Shot​,"This model treats the Shoot and the Fire All actions as (Simple) rather than (Basic), as long as they do not attack with a weapon that has the Unwieldy trait (note that even if a skill or Wargear item allows a model to ignore one aspect of the Unwieldy trait, Unwieldy weapons retain the Trait).",
SHOOTING​,Gunfighter​,"If this model uses the Twin Guns Blazing rule to attack with two weapons with the Sidearm trait, they do not suffer the -1 penalty to their hit rolls and can, if they wish, target a different enemy model with each weapon with the Sidearm trait.",
SHOOTING​,Hip Shooting​,"If the model is a vehicle, it treats the Move & Shoot action as (Simple) rather than (Basic) as long as it does not attack with a weapon that has the Unwieldy trait (note that even if a skill or Wargear item allows a model to ignore one aspect of the Unwieldy trait, Unwieldy weapons retain the Trait). If the model is a fighter and is Standing and Active, they can make the following action:","Run and Gun (Double): The fighter may move up to double their Movement characteristic and then make an attack with a ranged weapon. The hit roll suffers an additional -1 modifier, and Unwieldy weapons can never be used in conjunction with this skill."
SHOOTING​,Marksman​,"The model is not affected by the rules for Target Priority. In addition, if the hit roll for an attack made by the model with a ranged weapon (that does not have the Blast trait) is a natural 6, they score a critical hit and the weapon’s Damage is doubled (if they are firing a weapon with the Rapid Fire trait, only the Damage of the first hit is doubled).",
SHOOTING​,Precision Shot​,"If the hit roll for a ranged attack made by this model is a natural 6 (when using a weapon that does not have the Blast trait), the shot hits an exposed area and no armour save can be made.",
SHOOTING​,Trick Shot​,"When this model makes ranged attacks, they do not suffer a penalty for the target being engaged or in partial cover. In addition, if the target is in full cover, they reduce the penalty to their hit roll to -1 rather than -2.",
